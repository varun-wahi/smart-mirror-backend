        "question": "Explain the concept of ARP spoofing and how to protect against it.",
        "ideal_answer": "ARP spoofing is an attack where a malicious device sends fake ARP messages to associate its MAC address with the IP address of another device, allowing it to intercept or alter network traffic. To protect against ARP spoofing, techniques like static ARP entries, using secure protocols like HTTPS, and implementing ARP monitoring and detection tools are used.",

        "question": "What is the difference between TCP and SCTP?",
        "ideal_answer": "TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a connection-oriented protocol that provides reliable data transmission with error checking and flow control. SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) also offers reliable, message-oriented communication but supports multi-homing and message fragmentation, making it better suited for applications like VoIP and mobile communications.",

        "question": "What is the concept of QoS (Quality of Service) and how does it improve network performance?",
        "ideal_answer": "QoS is a set of techniques to manage network traffic and prioritize certain types of data (like voice or video) to ensure reliable performance. It improves network performance by allocating more bandwidth to high-priority traffic, reducing latency and jitter, and ensuring better user experience in time-sensitive applications.",

        "question": "What is the purpose of a firewall, and how does it work?",
        "ideal_answer": "A firewall is a security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. It works by filtering traffic, blocking malicious connections, and allowing legitimate communication. Firewalls can operate at different levels (e.g., network, application) and can be hardware or software-based.",

        "ideal_answer": "VPLS is a Layer 2 VPN technology that allows multiple geographically dispersed sites to appear as part of the same local area network (LAN). It enables Ethernet-based multipoint-to-multipoint communication over a wide area network (WAN), offering the scalability of IP with the flexibility of Ethernet.",

        "question": "What is SDN (Software-Defined Networking), and how does it differ from traditional networking?",
        "ideal_answer": "SDN is an approach to network management where the control plane is decoupled from the data plane, allowing centralized control of the network. It differs from traditional networking, where control and data planes are coupled in each network device, limiting flexibility and scalability. SDN allows dynamic configuration and automation of network behavior.",

        "question": "What is the role of TCP congestion window in the context of performance?",
        "ideal_answer": "The TCP congestion window controls the number of packets a sender can transmit before waiting for an acknowledgment. It dynamically adjusts based on network conditions to avoid congestion. A larger congestion window allows more data to be sent, improving throughput, but too large a window can lead to congestion and packet loss.",

        "ideal_answer": "A man-in-the-middle attack occurs when an attacker intercepts and possibly alters the communication between two parties. It can be mitigated using encryption (e.g., TLS/SSL) to ensure data integrity and confidentiality, mutual authentication, and using secure communication channels.",
